## Brief 

Starting from the concept of a pinboard, implement a web page that:

- is responsive (properly layout for smartphone, tablet, and desktop)
- allows the user to add and remove elements
- allows the user to customize elements (i.e. colors, size)
- allows the switch between two views (at least)

## Project Description

This cute little website helps you track and organize the yoga poses you've learned. Add new poses to your collection and assign each one a custom color - whether to indicate difficulty level, pose type, or any system that works for you.


Toggle between list and card view to see your poses in different layouts. It is adviced to keep practicing regularly, or you'll need to remove poses from your list!
